         * STATIC => non-instantable, if it applied to a class no "new" keyword can be used
         * if static applied to a class method, property, variable, then it can be utilised 
         * without creating an object itself. There is a case when static constructor
         * could be used but it will run only once when the first object is created.
         * 
         * 
         * ABSTRACT CLASS => used as a base class, lets say we have an ANIMAL base class
         * we dont know what animal its going to be, that would have to be defined in DOG class
         * which will create its own functionality based on ANIMAL Abstract class. Basically its a requirement
         * of how a class should look like and what methods it needs to have. Can have no method
         * declaration or can have some of it unlike interface.
         * 
         *

         * 
         * INTERFACE - has methods but not defined
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * OTHER
         * 
         * private -> can be acessed in the same CS file, hence no external can acess it
         * public -> all can acess it
         * protected -> has to inherit to access it
         * 
         * 
         * Collections: to hold values or objects
         * */
