# Foundations c#

1) `List<type> = new List<type>();` before it used to be `ArrayList = new ArrayList()`
 where u can insert any object without specifying the type, but if u want to assign any element from array list
to a variable u have to explicitly declare its type like `int val = (int)list[0]` assuming that element indexed at 0
is an int.
